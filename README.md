For the module 19 challenge, a text editor was created that runs in the browser.
The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. 
Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques 
that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported 
by the browser. The application will also function offline.
